        <h1>Welcome to our website</h1>
        <p>Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun
            we soak in, the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and
            consists of both living and non-living things.</p>
        <p>The air we breathe, the water we drink, the land we live upon, the soil we use to build our houses, and the
            fruit and vegetables we eat, all comes under nature. There are some untouchable things which can only be
            felt like the beauty of hills, the aroma of flowers, and the taste of fruits, etc</p>
        <p>Our forests, rivers, oceans and soils provide us with the food we eat, the air we breathe, the water we
            irrigate our crops with. We also rely on them for numerous other goods and services we depend on for our
            health, happiness and prosperity. These natural assets are often called the world's 'natural capital'.</p>
        <p>Nature has been found to have a calming quality on our stress levels. Beautiful natural surroundings and
            scenery can feel like worlds away from our home and work life and consequently causes us to put any
            associated stress on the back burner. A study explored the effect of nature on the stress hormone cortisol.
        </p>
        <p>Spending time in nature also inspires a sense of awe. This feeling that the world is so much bigger than you
            can comprehend leads to “expansive thinking,” which allows us to consider different perspectives and can
            lead to innovative ideas</p>
        <p>Water is the most precious gift of nature. It has no taste, no smell and no color. It is found everywhere and
            the other name of it is life. We find it in tanks, ponds, wells, rivers and springs.</p>
        <p>Setting Sun, starry night, silvery light of the Moon, snow-covered mountains, deep and dark forests, scent
            and fragrance of flowers are some of the beauties of Nature. The chirping of birds in trees has a music of
            its own. In Spring, Nature is at her best. Blooming flowers of different hues fill the air with fragrance.
        </p>
        <p>Plants, rocks, sand, soil, sea and streams are all natural. They are not made by people.
            ...
            A hill is a high place.
            A mountain is higher than a hill.
            A creek is water that moves along.
            A river is like a creek but very big and long.
            Trees and rocks are part of the land.</p>
